# RITURN

This is the functional prototype for RITURN, a ride-parcel-pooling service founded during the tech challenge powered by UnternehmerTUM.

The current version of the prototype covers two main functionalities. The first is the possibility for the user to register a return parcel and receive a QR code for it. The second is that the QR codes can be managed and utilized in the usersâ€™ personal profiles.

The app was tested using iOS version 17.2. However it is also compatible with lower iOS versions and Android.

## How to run the code
